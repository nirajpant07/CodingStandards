A comprehensive collection of enterprise-grade coding standards, best practices, and guidelines for modern software development. This repository serves as the authoritative source for development standards across our technology stack.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains detailed coding standards that promote consistency, maintainability, security, and performance across development teams. These standards are based on industry best practices from Microsoft, Google, GitHub, and other technology leaders, adapted for enterprise environments.

### Key Principles

- **Security First**: OWASP compliance and proactive security measures
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient patterns and scalable solutions  
- **Maintainable Code**: Clear, documented, and testable implementations
- **Compliance Ready**: GDPR, accessibility, and regulatory requirements
- **Modern Practices**: Latest language features and industry standards

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For New Projects

1. **Choose your technology stack** from the standards above
2. **Copy configuration files** from the relevant standard to your project
3. **Install recommended tools** (linters, formatters, analyzers)
4. **Set up CI/CD pipelines** using the provided templates
5. **Configure your IDE** with the included settings

### For Existing Projects

1. **Review current codebase** against the applicable standards
2. **Gradually introduce standards** starting with new code
3. **Use automated tools** to identify and fix violations
4. **Update documentation** to reflect the new standards
5. **Train team members** on the adopted standards

### Essential Tools Setup

```bash
# .NET Development
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-format
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-outdated-tool

# SQL Server Development

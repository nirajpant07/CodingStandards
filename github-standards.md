# GitHub Standards

*Last Updated: July 18, 2025*

This document outlines comprehensive GitHub standards and best practices for version control, collaboration, and development workflows. These standards ensure consistency across all repositories and teams.

## Table of Contents

- [Commit Message Standards](#commit-message-standards)

- [Git Workflow Commands](#git-workflow-commands)
- [Branch Naming Conventions](#branch-naming-conventions)
- [Code Review Guidelines](#code-review-guidelines)

## Commit Message Standards

### Format Structure

We follow the Conventional Commits specification, which provides a structured format for commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

| **Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| feat | New feature for the user | feat: add user authentication |
| fix | Bug fix for the user | fix: resolve login redirect issue |
| docs | Documentation changes | docs: update API documentation |
| style | Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc.) | style: fix indentation in user.js |
| refactor | Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features | refactor: extract payment logic |
| perf | Performance improvements | perf: optimize database queries |
| test | Adding or updating tests | test: add unit tests for auth module |
| build | Changes to build system or dependencies | build: update webpack config |
| ci | Changes to CI configuration | ci: add automated testing workflow |
| chore | Maintenance tasks | chore: update dependencies |
| revert | Reverting previous commits | revert: undo feature X implementation |

### Commit Message Rules

Based on industry best practices, follow these guidelines:

1. **Subject Line (50 characters max)**
   - Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added" or "Adding")
   - Capitalize the first letter
   - No period at the end
   - Be specific and descriptive

2. **Body (72 characters per line)**
   - Explain the "what" and "why", not the "how"
   - Separate from subject with a blank line
   - Use present tense

3. **Footer**
   - Reference issues: Closes #123
   - Breaking changes: BREAKING CHANGE: description

### Commit Message Templates

**Basic Feature**
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration

Implement Google OAuth2 authentication to allow users to sign in
with their Google accounts. This reduces friction in the signup
process and improves user experience.

- Add OAuth2 service configuration
- Create Google login button component
- Update user model to support OAuth users

Closes #456
```

**Bug Fix**
```
fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint

Prevent server crashes when user data is incomplete by adding
proper null checks and default values.

- Add null validation for user fields
- Return appropriate error messages
- Update tests to cover edge cases

Fixes #789
```

**Breaking Change**
```
feat(api)!: update user authentication flow

BREAKING CHANGE: The authentication endpoint now requires
a different request format. Update client applications to
use the new schema.

Migrates from basic auth to JWT tokens for improved security
and scalability.

Closes #234
```

**Documentation Update**
```
docs: add deployment guide

Create comprehensive deployment documentation including:
- Environment setup instructions
- Configuration examples
- Troubleshooting common issues

Closes #567
```

## Git Workflow Commands

### Basic Branch Operations

**Create and Switch to New Branch**
```bash
# Create new branch from current branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Create branch from specific commit
git checkout -b hotfix/login-bug abc123

# Create branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

**Switch Between Branches**
```bash
# Switch to existing branch
git checkout main
git checkout feature/user-auth

# Switch using git switch (Git 2.23+)
git switch main
git switch feature/user-auth

# Create and switch in one command
git switch -c feature/new-feature
```

### Keeping Branches Updated

**Update Main Branch**
```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Switch to main and update
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

**Sync Feature Branch with Main**
```bash
# Option 1: Merge (preserves commit history)
git checkout feature/user-auth
git merge main

# Option 2: Rebase (cleaner history)
git checkout feature/user-auth
git rebase main
```

### Rebase Operations

**Basic Rebase**
```bash
# Rebase current branch onto main
git rebase main

# Rebase specific branch
git rebase main feature/user-auth

# Rebase with specific commit
git rebase abc123
```

**Interactive Rebase (Clean Up Commits)**
```bash
# Rebase last 3 commits interactively
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Rebase from specific commit
git rebase -i abc123
```

**Interactive Rebase Commands:**
- `pick` - Use the commit as is
- `reword` - Use commit but edit message
- `edit` - Use commit but stop for amending
- `squash` - Combine with previous commit
- `drop` - Remove the commit

**Rebase Feature Branch on Main**
```bash
# Complete workflow for rebasing feature branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/user-auth
git rebase main

# If conflicts occur, resolve them then:
git add .
git rebase --continue

# Force push rebased branch (only for feature branches)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/user-auth
```

### Merge Conflict Resolution

**Identify Conflicts**
```bash
# Check status during conflict
git status

# See conflicted files
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
```

**Resolve Conflicts Manually**
1. Open conflicted files in your editor
2. Look for conflict markers:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   Your current branch changes
   =======
   Changes from other branch
   >>>>>>> branch-name
   ```
3. Edit to resolve conflicts
4. Remove conflict markers
5. Stage resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add conflicted-file.js
   ```

**Complete Resolution**
```bash
# After resolving all conflicts
git add .

# For merge conflicts
git commit

# For rebase conflicts
git rebase --continue

# To abort merge/rebase
git merge --abort
git rebase --abort
```

**Advanced Conflict Resolution Tools**
```bash
# Use merge tool
git mergetool

# See differences during conflict
git diff
git diff --staged

# Show conflict in different format
git checkout --conflict=diff3 file.txt
```

### Working with Remote Branches

**Push Changes**
```bash
# Push new branch to remote
git push -u origin feature/user-auth

# Push changes to existing remote branch
git push origin feature/user-auth

# Force push (use carefully!)
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/user-auth
```

**Pull Request Workflow**
```bash
# Before creating PR
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/user-auth
git rebase main  # or merge main
git push origin feature/user-auth

# After PR is approved and merged
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/user-auth  # Delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature/user-auth  # Delete remote branch
```

**Fetch and Pull**
```bash
# Fetch all remote changes without merging
git fetch origin

# Fetch specific branch
git fetch origin main

# Pull and merge
git pull origin main

# Pull and rebase
git pull --rebase origin main
```

### Stashing Changes

**Basic Stash Operations**
```bash
# Stash current changes
git stash

# Stash with message
git stash push -m "Work in progress on login feature"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply latest stash
git stash pop

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{1}

# Drop stash
git stash drop stash@{0}
```

### Advanced Git Commands

**Cherry-pick Commits**
```bash
# Cherry-pick specific commit
git cherry-pick abc123

# Cherry-pick range of commits
git cherry-pick abc123..def456

# Cherry-pick without committing
git cherry-pick --no-commit abc123
```

**Reset Operations**
```bash
# Soft reset (keep changes staged)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Mixed reset (keep changes unstaged)
git reset HEAD~1

# Hard reset (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Reset to specific commit
git reset --hard abc123
```

**Useful Aliases**

Add these to your `.gitconfig`:

```ini
[alias]
    co = checkout
    br = branch
    ci = commit
    st = status
    unstage = reset HEAD --
    last = log -1 HEAD
    visual = !gitk
    lg = log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
    please = push --force-with-lease
```

## Branch Naming Conventions

### Guidelines
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Be descriptive but concise
- Include ticket number if applicable: `feature/AUTH-123-oauth-integration`
- Avoid special characters except hyphens and forward slashes

## Code Review Guidelines

### Before Submitting PR
- [ ] Self-review your code
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
